Just because i got utterly annoyed by all sorts of phishing tests that go around these days!

This repo is a WIP, please add if you find more unique identifiers in phishing campaign emails 

Please find the following information in this repo

filters.txt (all headers, texts and other match criteria which you can filter on)

source/$vendor$/ (example mails with their headers if available)
